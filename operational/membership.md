## Overview

The OWASP Foundation is a member-led organization. Members serve as Board Members, Leaders, and volunteers for our community. Members have a vote in the election of OWASP Leaders. Membership is a privilege guided by the [Code of Conduct](/www-policy/operational/code-of-conduct), which has dues set by the OWASP Board of Directors, and are detailed below. Discounts are available for students, multi-year memberships, and for people living in developing economies. Complementary membership is available for active leaders, and Honorary Lifetime Membership may be granted by the Board of Directors for extraordinary service to OWASP and its mission over a long period of time.

## Membership

Membership is explicitly defined as people or corporations that pay dues along with those granted by the Board of Directors. Nearly all OWASP activities are open to both members and nonmembers. Some example activities include participating in a Project or Chapter, attending chapter meetings, joining mailing lists or attending events. Merely participating in the activities of the OWASP Foundation does not make that person a Member; membership includes only those who pay dues to the OWASP Foundation.

Individual Members can check their Membership Status, renewal dates, and for auto-renewing Memberships update their billing information by visiting the [Manage your Membership Form](/manage-membership). Members must provide the email address used when applying for membership, and if a member matches that address, an email will be sent to verify or update membership.

Members in "good standing" are defined as those who have paid dues appropriate with their membership level while also not subject to any disciplinary action(s) by the OWASP Foundation. When determining "continuous" membership status, a grace period of seven (7) days is permitted between the expiration and resumption of a person's membership.

While the Foundation will make diligent efforts to inform members of their membership - in particular expiration dates - it is the sole responsibility of the member to manage their membership and renewals.

## Becoming an Individual Member

Individuals can only become members of the OWASP Foundation by completing the [Membership Form](/membership) on our website and paying dues, and complying with the following conditions:

* Membership dues are to be paid by the Member and cannot be subsidized or funded by OWASP Projects, Chapters, or Events.
* Applicants must provide their country of residence, postal code, email address, name, and billing information. These details are subject to GDPR privacy protections, and the Foundation will not share private information without consent.
* Members are not attached to any particular Chapter or Project but are at-large members by submitting the Membership Form.
* Applicants consent to receive communications from the OWASP Foundation concerning membership status.
* Only qualifying individuals will be eligible for Complimentary, Regional, and Student Memberships.
* Once paid, Membership Dues are not prorated, nor can they be canceled once purchased.

The OWASP Foundation is the exclusive grantor of OWASP Memberships. No person or entity can act as a membership agent or grant Honorary or Complimentary memberships except for the OWASP Board of Directors.

The Foundation will revoke fraudulent membership submissions without notice and no refund. Memberships and member benefits are not transferrable.

## Individual Membership Types

**One or Two-Year** Dues $50 and $95 for each respective period. Individuals can choose either a single or two-year membership. Members will begin to receive renewal email reminders as early as 60 days before renewal. The OWASP Foundation will do its best to notify members of impending renewals. It is the sole responsibility of the Member to monitor their membership status.

**Lifetime Membership** When a member makes a time non-refundable $500 payment to the Foundation, they are granted a lifetime membership, which gives them all membership rights, including the ability to vote. Lifetime membership applies until the member passes away.

**Student Membership** Dues $20 per year. Full-time students may apply for this discounted membership. Student Members cannot auto-renew.

**Developing Economy Membership Pricing** Persons living in developing economies as defined in the lower 50% percentile Adjusted Net National Income Per Capita Countries, according to the World Bank, shall be offered any membership class at 2/5ths the rate of the standard membership, so $8 for student, $20 for one year, $35 for two year, and $200 for Lifetime membership.

**Complimentary Membership** Individual Membership offered, dues-free, to active leaders in good standing who have contributed materially to the Foundation over an extended period (see below).

**Honorary Lifetime Membership** Honorary Lifetime Membership, has the same benefits as Lifetime Membership described above, but is awarded by the Global Board of Directors for extraordinary contributions to OWASP over an extended period of time.

## Complimentary Membership

Complimentary Membership may be offered on an opt-in and automated basis to the top 5 active leaders of any chapter, project, event, or committee that supports the Foundation's mission and purpose, is in good standing subject to our Code of Ethics, and has been in the top 5 position continuously for six months prior to applying for complimentary membership.

Complimentary Membership is valid for one year. Leaders do not need to accept any offer of complementary leadership. Complementary members in good standing for 12 months may stand for the Board, but if elected, must maintain good standing with paid Membership. Directors who are eligible through the above criteria must not accept Complimentary Membership during their term and maintain good standing with paid Membership.

Active leaders can accept the complimentary membership using the standard "Join" or "Renew" OWASP membership form. Complimentary membership must be manually renewed each 12 months.

## Honorary Lifetime Membership

Honorary Membership is equivalent to Lifetime Individual Membership. Honorary Membership shall be determined and approved solely by a majority vote of the Board of Directors for long-standing and extraordinary services to the OWASP Community.

Nominations for honorary memberships can be [submitted here](https://owasp.wufoo.com/forms/honorary-membership-application/).

## Becoming a Corporate Member

Organizations can also become members of the OWASP Foundation. Those details can be found on the [Supporters page](/supporters) under Corporate Membership.
