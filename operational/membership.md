## Overview

The OWASP Foundation is a member-led organization. Members serve as Board Members, Leaders, and volunteers for our community. Voting Members have a vote in the election of OWASP Global Board of Directors and Committee Officers. Membership is a privilege guided by the [Code of Conduct](/www-policy/operational/code-of-conduct), which has dues set by the OWASP Board of Directors, and are detailed below. Discounts are available for students, multi-year memberships, and for people living in developing economies. Complimentary membership is available for active leaders, and Distinguished Lifetime Membership may be granted by the Board of Directors for extraordinary service to OWASP and its mission over a long period of time.

## Membership

Membership is explicitly defined as individuals that pay dues along with those granted by the Board of Directors. Nearly all OWASP activities are open to both members and nonmembers. Some example activities include participating in a Project or Chapter, attending chapter meetings, joining mailing lists or attending events. Merely participating in the activities of the OWASP Foundation does not make that person a Member; membership includes only those who pay dues to the OWASP Foundation.

Individual Members can check their Membership Status, renewal dates, and for auto-renewing Memberships update their billing information by visiting the [Manage your Membership Form](/manage-membership). Members must provide the email address used when applying for membership, and if a member matches that address, an email will be sent to verify or update membership.

Members in "good standing" are defined as those who have paid dues appropriate with their membership level while also not subject to any disciplinary action(s) by the OWASP Foundation. When determining "continuous" membership status, a grace period of seven (7) days is permitted between the expiration and resumption of a person's membership.

While the Foundation will make diligent efforts to inform members of their membership - in particular expiration dates - it is the sole responsibility of the member to manage their membership and renewals.

## Becoming an Individual Member

Individuals can only become members of the OWASP Foundation by completing the [Membership Form](/membership) on our website and paying dues, and complying with the following conditions:

- Membership dues are to be paid by the Member and cannot be subsidized or funded by OWASP Projects, Chapters, or Events.
- Applicants must provide their country of residence, postal code, email address, name, and billing information. These details are subject to GDPR privacy protections, and the Foundation will not share private information without consent.
- Members are not attached to any particular Chapter or Project but are at-large members by submitting the Membership Form.
- Applicants consent to receive communications from the OWASP Foundation concerning membership status.
- Only qualifying individuals will be eligible for Complimentary, Developing Economy, and Student Memberships.
- Once paid, Membership Dues are not prorated, nor can they be canceled once purchased.

The OWASP Foundation is the exclusive grantor of OWASP Memberships. No person or entity can act as a membership agent, or grant Distinguished Lifetime Membership except for the OWASP Board of Directors.

The Foundation will revoke fraudulent membership submissions without notice and no refund. Memberships and member benefits are not transferrable.

## Individual Membership Types

**One or Two-Year** Individuals can choose either a single or two-year membership. Members will begin to receive renewal email reminders as early as 60 days before renewal. The OWASP Foundation will do its best to notify members of impending renewals. It is the sole responsibility of the Member to monitor their membership status.

**Student Membership** Full-time students may apply for this discounted membership. Student Members cannot auto-renew.

**Developing Economy Membership Pricing** Persons living in developing economies as defined in the lower 50% percentile Adjusted Net National Income Per Capita Countries, according to the World Bank, shall be offered any membership class at 2/5ths the rate of the standard membership.

**Complimentary Membership** is a non-voting individual membership class to allow OWASP participants, such as chapter attendees, event volunteers, and project contributors to more closely support the mission of the Foundation. Complimentary Members cannot lead chapters, projects, or events; or vote for, stand, or take up elected positions.

**Lifetime Membership** Lifetime Membership confers  all individual membership rights and benefits, including the right to vote. Lifetime Membership applies until the member passes away.

**Distinguished Lifetime Membership** Distinguished Lifetime Membership is awarded by the Global Board of Directors once or twice a year for extraordinary contributions to OWASP over an extended period of time. Nominations for Distinguished Lifetime Membership can be [submitted here](https://owasp.wufoo.com/forms/distinguished-lifetime-membership-nomination/).

## Complimentary Membership

Complimentary Membership is a non-voting Individual Membership class open to all OWASP participants. Complimentary Membership does not come with an OWASP email address or any other paid Member benefits.

Complimentary Membership is valid for one year, and must be renewed annually.

Complimentary members in good standing for 12 months may stand for the Board or as a Committee Officer, but must convert to and maintain good standing with paid Membership to satisfy Board or Committee Officer requirements, including the right to vote.

Committee Officers or Directors who are eligible through the above criteria must not accept Complimentary Membership during their term and maintain good standing with paid Membership.
