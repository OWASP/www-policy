Chapters, Projects and groups are overseen on an operational basis by the Foundation Staff and, ultimately, the OWASP Board of Directors.

Additionally, OWASP administrative access (including the leader’s owasp.org email address) may be immediately revoked.

### Legal Entity
Chapters, Projects and groups are not legal entities and are organized under the authority of the OWASP Foundation. As non-legal entities Leaders or members of Chapters, Projects, or groups cannot sign contracts, hold independent insurance, or transact funds independently of the OWASP Foundation. Groups operate with a great deal of freedom; however groups must abide by the Code of Conduct, Foundation bylaws, and the polices in these Rules of Procedure.

Due process is expected and stakeholders should be given sufficient notice of upcoming decisions which might require a formal vote.
