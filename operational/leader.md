## Section 2: Governance

### Oversight
Chapters, Projects and groups are overseen on an operational basis by the Foundation Staff and, ultimately, the OWASP Board of Directors. If the Foundation Staff or Board of Directors determines that a Leader has not complied with these rules, their status as a Leader may be revoked. Additionally, OWASP administrative access (including the leaderâ€™s owasp.org email address) may be immediately revoked.

### Legal Entity
Chapters, Projects and groups are not legal entities and are organized under the authority of the OWASP Foundation. As non-legal entities Leaders or members of Chapters, Projects, or groups cannot sign contracts, hold independent insurance, or transact funds independently of the OWASP Foundation. Groups operate with a great deal of freedom; however groups must abide by the Code of Conduct, Foundation bylaws, and the polices in these Rules of Procedure.

### Leadership

The Foundation strives to operate in a consensus-driven decision making environment. Groups are encouraged to negotiate a common ground with regard to decisions and policy. However, at times it may be necessary to vote on decisions. Only OWASP Members have voting rights and all matters will be decided on a simple majority. Due process is expected and stakeholders should be given sufficient notice of upcoming decisions which might require a formal vote.

### Disputes

1. Bring your concern to the attention of your group's Leaders or Leadership team.
2. If you are unable to resolve at the local level, please contact staff through the Contact form.
3. If staff is unable to handle your concern or you would like to challenge their feedback/decision, the concern can be raised with the OWASP Board of Directors.

If you feel an Code of Ethics violation has occurred, you may review the [Whistleblower Policy](/www-policy/operational/whistleblower) for instructions on how to file a complaint.
