[ Reviewers - Please review the draft &#169; notice below detailing the provenance of this events policy. Please point out any issues with our fork, including any issues relating to programs OWASP does not have (such as certification) or software OWASP does not use. ]

## Timelines

Events take time to plan, organize, and promote. All event types require event pre-approval before the event to ensure that local or regional events do not clash with each other or Foundation events, as well as to ensure that the events have time to be organized properly, and shared services provided by the Foundation such as social media promotion, contract signing, insurance, virtual services, and so on can be provided.

The following minimum timelines apply to events with a budget that exceeds USD $10,000 requesting Foundation Financial Support:

- Local events: Must be submitted by September 1 the year prior to the event taking place.
- AppSec Days: All AppSec Days events must be submitted by September 1 the year prior to the event taking place.
- Global events: 360 days prior to the event

Event teams must coordinate with the OWASP Foundation to ensure that there are no other nearby or global events or activities that would drain attendees from both events. Events within 30 days of an AppSec Global event will likely need to be rescheduled, as being too close to the AppSec Global event will likely result in poor attendance for both events.

No more than 30 days following the submission of a completed event submission, the Director of Events and Corporate Support or their designated representative shall approve or deny an Event Application. If rejected, the team shall be given additional time to improve the application or resolve issues as long as the deadlines above are met.

Events contingent on exemptions being passed by the Board require an additional 45-60 days for approval due to Board meeting schedules.

If selected, the Event Team must acknowledge receipt of and their agreement with these policies and any granted exemptions. All contracts must be signed by the Foundation.
