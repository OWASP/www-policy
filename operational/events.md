# Classes of Events

OWASP Events are grouped into three classes: (1) Global, (2) Regional, and (3) Local. Many of the Event policies below apply to all events regardless of class and differences are noted below. At the discretion of the Executive Director, or their designatee, generally the definition of these classes are:
1. Global: Staff managed events that include training, conference, and an exhibition hosted over a 4-5 day program. Financially supported by Sponsors and Attendee registration fees. Program Teams are constituted to guide and select conference program including keynotes, speakers, and trainers.
2. Regional. OWASP local chapter managed events hosted over a 1-5 day program includes a conference and also may include  trainings and an exhibition hosted over a 4-5 day program. Supported by Sponsors and Attendee registration fees.
3. Local. OWASP local chapter managed events that typically only include presentations and may be hosted with a coordinating third party non-profit organization.

# General Policies

## Event Teams
Events shall be organized, managed, and led by an Event Team. Global Events are organized by a per event [Program Team](/www-policy/operational/program-team) and are selected through a competitive application process. Regional and Local Events may organize their team at their discretion; however it is a requirement that Event Team members also be OWASP Members. Leaders of these Teams should strive to involve both longtime and new members of the OWASP Community. Events should be transparent of who is on its Event Team. Members of Event Teams will be not compensated for their volunteer work but shall receive a conference pass for the event organized.

## Content
Events offer unique opportunities for potential speakers to share their views with AppSec leaders in the OWASP Community. Where possible organizing teams should source content through a blind review process to ensure the highest integrity and objectivity in its selection. All calls for papers, training, and registration must be open and promoted to the public.

Generally the Community is more receptive to new talks, not ones presented at previous conferences. It is the discretion of the Event Team on the archival of talks following their conference. Content will be shared with the community when possible. OWASP will not incur additional expenses such as web casting, third party hosting sites, or video recording in order to make the content available to those that were not in attendance.

## Keynote, Speaker and Training Agreements

Presenters at OWASP Events are required to sign and adhere to the terms of the [speaker/trainer agreement](/www-policy/legal/speaker-agreement). An online version can be provided to Regional Event Teams upon request. Failure by presenters to execute this agreement within seven days of the event results in their session being cancellation. While the complete terms are included in the agreement it should be highlighted that:
- Speakers do not any receive compensation for their participation
- Travel expenses are not reimbursable for Speakers or Trainers

## Marketing

Event Teams are responsible for the majority of marketing activities promoting their event.  Additionally the Team is responsible for ensuring event website content is current and when requested, must provide administrative access to OWASP staff. Event Team Leaders will provide content for the ticketing/registration site no later than 15 days prior to registration launch date.

The Foundation will provide social media and email support where possible.

## Site Selection/Venue

Cities and venues for OWASP Events shall be selected through an Request for Proposal (RFP) process. Criteria for selection will include but will not be limited to:
- Accessibility
- Local community/security community presence
- Venue availability
- Value for attendees

## Vendors

All vendors shall be selected through the Request for Proposal (RFP) process. Vendors will be selected based on the value they are able to provide to the conference.

## Budgets

Budgets for all events will be developed based on vendor and venue proposals along with forecasted revenue. Global Event budgets shall be presented to the Board of Directors for its approval no later than 16 months prior to the start of the conference. Regional and Local Events must submit their budget as part of the Event Application Process. Once approved by the Executive Director, or their designatee, they will be the sole executor of instruments that contractually and financially obligate the OWASP Foundation to execute events.

All expense reimbursements and payments will be paid in accordance with the [expense policy](/www-policy/operational/expense-reimbursement) with particular attention to the following:
- It is the responsibility of those incurring expenses to obtain pre-approval of any unbudgeted expense likely to exceed $2,500 and failure to do so may result in your reimbursement request being denied.
- When any expense other than airfare is expected to exceed $5,000, an invoice must be requested from the vendor so the Foundation can remit payment directly.
- Invoices from vendors should have Net 60 terms and the OWASP Foundation will make a best effort to pay within the current Service Level Agreement. Invoices received within 30 days of when payment is required cannot be guaranteed to be paid on time.
- Invoices and expense reimbursements submitted more than 60 days following the event will be denied.

## Sponsorships

 The OWASP Foundation is the exclusive sponsorship agent of all OWASP Events. At the discretion of the Executive Director, the OWASP Foundation may provide services to Event Teams to identify, solicit, contract, invoice, and collect sponsorship revenue. In collaboration with the Foundation, Event Teams can develop a collection of sponsorship opportunities that offer unique value to partners when supporting these events. Event Teams acknowledge that pricing and benefits for their events must be compatible with offerings for Global AppSec events.

From time to time the OWASP Foundation may offer "bundled" sponsorships that may include benefits delivered through Regional Events. Both the OWASP Foundation and Regional Event Teams will make a best case effort to always ensure each partners' satisfaction with their sponsorship.

## Ticketing

All ticketing shall be done through OWASP managed services. Discount code requests shall be provided no later than 15 days prior to the opening of event ticketing. Each event has a revenue forecast that is built on a particular number of tickets sold at various discounts. Event Teams will make their best effort to achieve the events' revenue forecast.

Notwithstanding the Event Team, the volunteers, speakers, and OWASP staff, Event Teams are discouraged from providing complimentary tickets exceeding 20% of the total expected attendance. Complimentary ticket forecasts should be noted in the Event Budget.

All OWASP Event Teams and Leaders are explicitly prohibited from offering OWASP Membership sold separately or bundled with any attendee service or ticket.  Ticketing systems may not collect charitable gifts. Upon request, complimentary tickets shall be provided to Board Members and OWASP Staff to all OWASP Events.

## Profit Sharing (internal accounting practices)

Regional and Local Event Teams who comply with the terms of these policies will share 40% of OWASP event net profits. In the case of multiple host chapters, the host chapters will be responsible for determining the division before the event. An event Profit and Loss statement will be provided to all parties no later than 120 days following the event. Uncollected sponsorship revenue will not be included in this revenue reconciliation.

Local host chapters may share in Global AppSec event net profits up to 10% based on chapter participation. In the case of multiple host chapters, the host chapters will be responsible for determining the division before the event. Net profit sharing can be achieved by completing the following:

- Recruiting and supervising local volunteers
- Successfully marketing the Global AppSec in the local area (to be tracked by discount code)

For each Corporate Sponsorships sold and collected that select a Regional Event, that event's profit and loss statement shall be credited per the following schedule:

- $5,000 for total Event Revenue more than $250,000
- $2,500 for total Event Revenue more than $100,000 but less than $249,999
- $1,000 for total Event Revenue more up to $99,999

Additionally any other Sponsor Benefits beyond the standard base Event Sponsorship delivered through a Regional Event , shall also increase the Regional Event Teams' revenue, at the list price of those benefits.

## Safe and Fun Networking

All OWASP events must be conducted in a manner consistent with the OWASP Mission, Principles and [Code of Conduct](/www-policy/operational/code-of-conduct). To ensure a safe, consistent learning and networking experience, OWASP events shall conform to the [Conference & Event Attendee Policy](/www-policy/operational/conferences-events) and in particular its Anti-Harassment provisions. Additionally, organizers are required to follow the OWASP Foundation [Privacy Policy](/www-policy/operational/privacy) and ensure GDPR compliance.

## Event Volunteers

Event Teams are responsible for adequate staffing their event. Oftentimes in addition to the Events Team, events should source limited volunteers for their event from the Community; but a strong preference shall be given to OWASP Members. Leaders are encouraged to involve both longtime and new members of the OWASP Community. Generally it is recommended that volunteers commit to working at least a minimum of two four-hour shifts in exchange for a Conference pass to their volunteering event. No other compensation will be offered to Event Volunteers.
