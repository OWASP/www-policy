2.2. Independent Contractor Status. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that Consultant is an independent contractor to OWASP and not an employee, agent, joint venturer or partner of OWASP. Neither Consultant nor Consultant’s employees nor agents (including independent contractors, consultants and subcontractors) shall have the status or any rights of being an employee of OWASP and none of them shall participate in or receive any employee benefits pursuant to plans, group insurance, programs or arrangement (including, but not limited to, those providing for salary, vacation, bonus or incentive compensation, stock option/purchase, retirement, pension, deferred savings, disability, medical and dental) (together, “Benefits”) that OWASP provides or makes available to its employees, regardless of whether Consultant or its employees or agents (including independent contractors, consultants and subcontractors) otherwise are or should become eligible to participate in such Benefits.

Consultant agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the OWASP and its directors, officers and employees from and against all taxes, losses, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees and other legal expenses, arising directly or indirectly from or in connection with a determination by a court or agency that the Consultant is not an independent Consultant and any obligation imposed on OWASP to pay withholding taxes or similar items in respect of Consultant.

3.0. SERVICES; SUPERVISION BY OWASP

3.1. Services. Consultant agrees to provide the Services set forth on Exhibit A to OWASP with all due care, skill and ability and shall use its best efforts to promote the interests of OWASP.

Any such agreement regarding additional compensation shall be set forth in a signed, written amendment to this Agreement.
 
3.2. Method of Performing Services; Supervision. Consultant will generally determine the method, details and means of performing the Services provided, however, that Consultant is required to comply with OWASP’s reasonable instructions and co-operate with OWASP in all matters relating to the Services. Consultant shall observe OWASP’s security, safety and any other work-related policies at all times. In addition, OWASP shall be entitled to exercise a broad, general right of supervision and control over the results of the Services performed by Consultant to ensure satisfactory performance thereof. This power of supervision shall include the right to inspect, stop work, make suggestions or recommendations as to the details of the work, and request modifications to the scope of the Services.

3.3. Scheduling and Reporting. Consultant will use its best efforts to accommodate OWASP’s work schedule requests. If Consultant is unable to perform the scheduled Services because of illness or other causes beyond Consultant's reasonable control, Consultant will attempt to perform such Services as soon as is reasonably practicable. For clarity, no fee shall be payable in accordance with Exhibit A in respect of any period during which Services are not provided. During the term of the provision of the Services, the Consultant shall, on a monthly basis, submit written reports to OWASP’s executive management in connection with matters relating to the provision of the Services. Such report shall detail the activities performed by Consultant in the prior month in relation to the Services including, without limitation, progress reports on each aspect of the Services detailed in Exhibit A and all such information reasonably requested by OWASP.
3.4. Place of Work. Consultant will use reasonable efforts to be available on reasonable notice to attend meetings and provide assistance or information as OWASP may require. Consultant will perform the Services off-site in a distraction-free place and also at OWASP’s premises if requested by OWASP. OWASP agrees to provide such working space and facilities as may be reasonably necessary for Consultant to perform the Services at OWASP’s premises. OWASP may also require Consultant to travel occasionally to perform the Services. 

3.5 Individuals Providing Services. Each and every individual performing the Services on behalf of Consultant hereunder shall be listed on Exhibit C attached hereto. Exhibit C may be amended from time to time by a written update of the Exhibit signed by the parties.

Consultant shall inform all such employees of its obligations hereunder. 

4.2. Exclusions. The restrictions in Section 4.1 above shall not apply to information (i) generally available to the public; (ii) released by OWASP generally without restriction; or (iii) independently developed by Consultant without reliance in any way on Confidential Information.

4.3. Residual Rights of Consultant. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Consultant shall be free to use and employ its general skills, know-how and expertise, and to use, disclose and employ any generalized ideas, concepts, know-how, methods, techniques or skills gained or learned during the course of the performance of any Services, so long as Consultant acquires and applies such information without disclosure of any Confidential Information and without any unauthorized use or disclosure of any Work Product.

5.0. OWNERSHIP OF WORK.

Consistent with Consultant's recognition of OWASP’s absolute ownership of all Work Product, Consultant agrees that it shall (i) not use any Work Product for the benefit of any party other than OWASP, and (ii) perform such other acts and execute such other documents and instruments as OWASP may now or hereafter deem reasonably necessary or desirable to evidence the transfer of absolute ownership of all Work Product to OWASP. If, by operation of law, Consultant is deemed to retain any rights in and to any intellectual property created hereunder, Consultant, to the extent that any such rights conflict with any assignment of rights made by Consultant to OWASP hereunder, hereby waives all such rights and assigns to OWASP the rights set forth in this Section 5 above.

Consultant hereby acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing indemnity shall apply to the acts and omissions of its agents, employees, officers, partners, principals, contractors and subcontractors.

8.4. Delivery Of Materials Upon Termination. Consultant agrees that, in the event of termination or expiration of this Agreement for any reason, Consultant will promptly and without request surrender and deliver to OWASP all materials containing, embodying or otherwise evidencing any Confidential Information, regardless of whether any such item or the information contained therein or thereon was prepared, produced or authored by Consultant, except that Consultant may retain a copy of this Agreement for its records.

No portion of this Agreement or any of Consultant’s rights (including, without limitation, the right to payment for Services) or obligations hereunder may be assigned and/or delegated by Consultant without OWASP’s prior written consent, which consent may be granted or withheld in OWASP's sole and absolute discretion.
