Name of Employee: __________________________

I acknowledge that I have received a copy of the OWASP Employee Handbook dated: 2019-11-01. Except for differences in written and accepted employment offers, I understand that this employee handbook replaces any and all prior verbal and written communications regarding OWASP working conditions, policies, procedures, appeal processes, and benefits.

I have read and understood the contents of this handbook and will act in accordance with these policies and procedures as a condition of my employment with the OWASP Foundation.

I also acknowledge that the handbook contains an employment-at-will provision that states:

Your employment with The OWASP Foundation is at-will which means that you or The OWASP Foundation may terminate your employment at any time for any lawful reason unless a written employment agreement exists with The OWASP Foundation that provides otherwise. Your employment with Insperity is at-will regardless of whether you have a written employment agreement with The OWASP Foundation.

Finally, I understand that the contents of this employee handbook are simply policies and guidelines, not a contract or implied contract with employees. The contents of the employee handbook may change at any time.
