<strong>PRESENTER AGREEMENT & RELEASE</strong>

I accept the offer of the OWASP Foundation Inc., (the "Company") to participate as a conference keynote, speaker, or trainer (a "Presenter") as part of the event listed below (“Conference”) subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein.

I agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any claims, losses, expenses or damages that may be incurred by the Company as a result of my participating in Company events. In particular, I agree that the use of any materials prepared by me will not expose the Company to liability for breach of confidence for infringement of copyright or similar liability. 

In the unavoidable situation that I am unable to fulfill my commitment to present, I will promptly notify the primary point of contact of the event via telephone/email so that the Company may find an alternate Presenter for my session. If I violate the terms of this agreement or fail to meet any established deadlines, the Company reserves the right to replace me as a Presenter with another presenter from my company or organization or from another company or organization at the sole discretion of the Company.

The Conference program, including dates and sessions times, is designed at the sole discretion of the Company. Reasonable accommodations can be made for schedule requests but cannot always be guaranteed. The Conference program is finalized no later than fourteen (14) days prior to the event and up until that time, any session can be moved or cancelled.

<strong>REMUNERATION AND PAYMENT</strong>

As a Presenter, I will receive a single non-transferable admission pass to the event and other remuneration as listed below. Any remuneration or expense reimbursement request must be submitted to the Company Service Desk (OSD) with appropriate documentation no sooner than ten (10), and no later than ninety (90) days following the event in which I present. Remuneration and reimbursements are subject to the policies and procedures of the Company.

<strong>FOR SPEAKERS</strong>. I will not receive any compensation for presenting at this Event/Conference. Additionally I will not be reimbursed for any travel expenses such as airfare, housing, or any other daily expenses incurred while attending the Company’s Conference for which I am a Presenter. 

<strong>FOR CONFERENCE KEYNOTES</strong>. I will not receive any compensation for presenting at this Conference. However, the Company will reimburse fair and reasonable travel expenses in connection with the event for which I am a Presenter. This reimbursement may include Economy Airfare, or Premium Economy for flights greater than seven hours, lodging, and daily expenses for up to three days incurred while attending the Company’s Conference for which I am a Presenter. If housing arrangements are provided by the Company to the Presenter, separate lodging expenses will not be reimbursed.

<strong>FOR TRAINERS</strong>. For Global AppSec events I am eligible for up to $5,000 and one nights lodging in Company arranged lodging per full day of scheduled sessions for which I present. For other events, I am eligible according to terms in the Call for Trainers. I must provide appropriate taxing authority documentation as needed for final payment such as a W-9 in the United States. I will not be reimbursed for any travel expenses such as airfare, or any other daily expenses incurred while attending the Company’s Conference for which I am a Presenter.  

<strong>CONTENT </strong>

I understand that the views and opinions expressed at the Conference will be mine and not those of the Company. 

Presenters are encouraged to include their contact information when introducing themselves and their company logo if they want to on the corresponding slide, but are discouraged from including their logo on any other slide or handout materials. Presenters are to avoid any appearance of commercialism in their session and presentations are to be of a technical or solutions emphasis. Further, I understand that the program tracks of the Conference/event/chapter are an educational event, not a sales or marketing platform. I agree that my presentation(s) will be an objective review of the topic on which I am presenting, and will not contain any content that is a sales or promotional pitch for any specific product(s) or company(ies). My materials will also be reflective of the current status of the topic(s) I am addressing. 

I agree that the information contained in my presentation(s) or related presentation materials (a) will be factual and not misleading, (b) will not violate any obligation of confidentiality that I (or my company or 2 organization) has with any third party, (c) will not violate the intellectual property of any third party and (d) will not defame any third party. 

In addition, I agree that Company events are not an appropriate forum for disclosing vulnerabilities. I understand that presentations can discuss known vulnerabilities, types of vulnerabilities, new malicious uses of known vulnerabilities, and new vulnerabilities that span multiple products and standards. However, I will not discuss vulnerabilities in specific products. I agree to dedicate a substantial portion of my presentation to solutions for any issues raised. 

I may use the handout materials, presentation, visual aids and any other material prepared by me for the above-mentioned presentation in any manner I desire, including publication. Papers and illustrations will not be returned. 

Except for TRAINERS, if my session includes a presentation, I will use the Conference Template OWASP Presentation Template. I will submit to the Company’s Event Leader my presentation(s) in one of the previous formats no later than 15 days prior to the Conference. Should the presentation change after it has been submitted, I agree to notify the Company’s Event Leader that the presentation has changed and I will submit the changed presentation as soon as feasible and at least 24 hours prior to my scheduled session(s). 

<strong>COPYRIGHT PERMISSION</strong>

I understand that the Company may record (audio and/or video) the Conference keynotes and/or sessions, and, that my presentation could be included in any reproduction of those Conference materials. I hereby authorize the Company to capture my keynote and/or session presentation on audio/visual format or a combination thereof for presentation by OWASP Conference Organizers. Accordingly, for my keynote and/or sessions, I grant the Company the right to: (1) Reproduce and distribute the handout materials in any format including paper and electronic formats to any audience, and (2) Distribute written materials to participants of the OWASP Conferences. 

These Copyright Permissions do not apply to TRAINER sessions.
