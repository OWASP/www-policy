Each director must be elected as prescribed in the election policy and procedure. An individual is limited to no more than two (2) two-year (2) terms in a ten (10) year period.

The Officer roles of the Board Members shall be elected by the Board of Directors at the first meeting following the election of the Board of Directors.

Each officer shall hold that role until the next election has been completed.

### SECTION 2.03 Resignation

Resignations are effective upon receipt by the Secretary of the Board of a written notification.

### SECTION 2.04 Removal

Directors may be removed from office by the members, with or without cause, as permitted by and in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware. The Board will recommend to the Members that a Director be removed from office when there is a finding that a Director has committed an action that results in a finding of “Cause.” A determination of “Cause” by the Board of Directors requires an affirmative vote of the full number of voting Directors then in office, except for the Director being considered for removal. For the purpose of these Bylaws, the term “Cause” shall mean

(w) repeated violations of the Board Code of Conduct Policy or (x) a final conviction of a felony involving moral turpitude or (y) willful misconduct that is materially and demonstrably injurious to OWASP or (z) a no-confidence vote by the Board of Directors under Section 3.04 of the Bylaws.

For purposes of the definition of “Cause,” no act, or failure to act, by a Director shall be considered “willful” unless committed in bad faith and without a reasonable belief that the act or failure to act was in the best interest of OWASP. As voting by OWASP Members is optional, a simple majority of votes received by members in good standing shall govern if the Director is removed.

### SECTION 2.05 Vacancies

A vacancy in any office because of death, resignation, removal, disqualification or otherwise, may be filled by the Board of Directors for the unexpired portion of the term.

## ARTICLE III - BOARD OF DIRECTORS

### SECTION 3.01 General Powers and Authority

The business and affairs of the Foundation shall be managed by its Board of Directors

### SECTION 3.02 Number, Tenure, and Qualifications

The number of directors of the Foundation shall be no less than five and no more than seven. Each director shall hold office for two years unless duly removed. An individual is limited to four (4) elected two-year (2) terms effective January 1, 2014. Each director must be elected as prescribed in the election policy and procedure. An individual is limited to no more than two (2) two-year (2) terms in a ten (10) year period.

Directors are responsible for maintaining their membership in good standing for the duration of their term.

A Director or Candidate for the Board shall have maintained continuous membership in good standing over the previous 12 months, notwithstanding any grace periods established in these bylaws.

At the time of their election, to qualify to stand, candidates must hold an Individual membership, Lifetime membership, or hold a valid Distinguished Lifetime Membership. This membership must have been in place for a 12 month period prior to the date of the election.

Foundation funds should not be used to pay for membership. Foundation paid memberships of any class, from any funding source including conferences, chapters, projects, donations, etc, shall not constitute paid membership nor possess voting rights.

### SECTION 3.03 Regular Meetings

The Board of Directors shall have regular meetings as needed. A link to the board meeting agenda’s and the historical minutes is here: [https://owasp.org/www-board/](https://owasp.org/www-board/). Meetings shall be at such dates, times, and places as the Board shall determine in December of the preceding year and as amended by the Board. In no event will there be less than one meeting per quarter. These meetings will be open to public attendance. However, certain portions of the meeting may be closed to board members and their delegates when required for legal reasons, or to shield liability, or to handle personnel issues, or similar.

Attendance in person or virtually by board members is required at no less than 75% of the total meetings each year and shall be highly encouraged to meet in person at least once annually at a date to be announced and agreed upon. To be considered as “attended,” the board member must attend at least 90% of the meeting, starting at the published scheduled time until the published end time or the meeting is adjourned (whichever is earlier). Attendance is tabulated by the Executive Director or delegate within seven days after every scheduled meeting for the purpose of determining if the 75% attendance requirement has been met, and the tabulation is based upon the entire calendar year. Canceled meetings are considered attended for the purposes of the tabulation.

Failure by a board member to meet the 75% attendance requirement after any tabulation will cause a mandatory vote of confidence by the remaining board members, whose votes will be publicly recorded. If a vote of confidence does not pass, the Board will put forward a vote of removal to the members and recommend to remove the Director, per section 2.04.

### SECTION 3.04 Special Meetings

Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be called by or at the request of the Chair or any two (2) directors. The person or persons authorized to call special meetings of the Board of Directors may fix the place for holding any special meeting of the Board of Directors called by them.

### SECTION 3.05 Notice of Special Meetings

A special meeting may be called by the Chair or at the request of any two (2) Board members by notice emailed, telephone, or telegraphed to each Board member not less one week before such meetings. Any directors may waive notice of any meeting. The attendance of a director at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except where a director attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.

### SECTION 3.06 Quorum

A majority of the number of Directors fixed by ### SECTION 2 of this Article shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at any meeting of the Board of Directors. If less than such majority is present at a meeting, a majority of the Directors present may adjourn the meeting from time to time without further notice. Except as otherwise provided in these Bylaws, all decisions will be made by majority vote of those present at a meeting at which a quorum is present. If a board of Directors vote results in a split decision, the Chair of the Board, if present at the meeting, can decide the issue.

### SECTION 3.07 Participation in Meeting by Conference Telephone

Members of the Board may participate in a meeting through use of conference telephone or similar communication equipment, so long as members participating in such meeting can hear one another. A quorum must be maintained at all times during the meeting or the meeting will not continue.

### SECTION 3.08 Manner of Acting

Except as otherwise provided in these Bylaws, the act of the majority of the directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the Board of Directors.

### SECTION 3.09 Action Without a Meeting

Any action that may be taken by the Board of Directors at a meeting may be taken without a meeting if consent in writing, setting forth the action so to be taken, shall be agreed to before such action by a majority of the directors. Such consent can be provided by email, an electronic vote, or other mechanism as agreed upon by the Board.

### SECTION 3.10 Vacancies

Any vacancy occurring in the Board of Directors may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors though less than a quorum of the Board of Directors unless otherwise provided by law. If there is an equal number of affirmative and negative votes then the ultimate determination shall be made by the then­ sitting Chair of the Board. A director elected to fill a vacancy shall be elected for the unexpired term of his predecessor in office. Any directorship to be filled by reason of an increase in the number of directors may be filled by election by the Board of Directors for a term of office continuing only until the next election of directors by the Directors.

Appointed Directors filling a vacancy shall not have this partial term counted against term limits. Members can only be appointed to fill a vacancy once every ten years to prevent bypassing term limits.

### SECTION 3.11 Employment

No paid employee can serve on the Board of Directors or in the role of Officer while they are employed in a paid position by the Foundation.

### SECTION 3.12 Reimbursement

Directors shall serve without compensation with the exception that expenses incurred in the furtherance of the Foundation's business are allowed to be reimbursed with documentation and prior approval according to the Reimbursement Policy.

### SECTION 3.13 Presumption of Assent

A Director of the Foundation who is present at a meeting of the Board of Directors at which action on any corporate matter is taken shall be presumed to have assented to the action taken unless their dissent shall be entered in the minutes of the meeting or unless they shall file their written dissent to such action with the person acting as the Secretary of the meeting before the adjournment thereof, or shall forward such dissent to the Secretary of the Foundation immediately after the adjournment of the meeting. Such right to dissent shall not apply to any director who voted in favor of such action.

### SECTION 3.14 Good standing exemption due to Foundation membership system failure

Any member whose membership lapsed due to technical or procedural problems with the membership management system should be granted exemption from the "paid" component of the "in good standing" clause for eligibility. The exempted member must satisfy all of the following conditions:

- The member fulfills all requirements to stand for the Board; and
- The member can demonstrate evidence of having made a reasonable attempt to maintain continuous membership.

Evidence of having made a reasonable attempt to maintain continuous membership requires one or more of the following:

- An email trail between the member and the Foundation's staff showing an honest effort to pay for one's membership through acceptable means; or
- Evidence of a failed transaction to the OWASP account; or
- Evidence of a credit to the member's membership belatedly applied by the Foundation.

Should there be any doubt about the validity of the claim, a majority vote of the Board will decide the outcome on a case-by-case basis.

### SECTION 3.15 Good standing grace period

Directors and Candidates for the Board who have lapses in good standing have a grace period of 7 days to renew their membership. Directors or Candidates who fail to obtain paid individual or lifetime membership, Distinguished Lifetime membership, or renew their previous membership within the permitted grace period will not have maintained good standing for the purposes of election eligibility. Directors may continue to vote on the Board during the grace period.

### Section 3.16 ADOPTION OF ROBERTS RULES OF ORDER

The rules contained in the current edition of Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised (12th ed.) shall govern the OWASP Foundation Board and special meetings in all cases to which they are applicable and in which they are not inconsistent with the bylaws, and any special rules of order the Board may adopt.

## ARTICLE IV - MEMBERS

### SECTION 4.01 Membership Classes

There shall be the following classes of OWASP members: Corporate, Individual, Complementary, Lifetime, Distinguished Lifetime, and Student.

### SECTION 4.02 Qualifications

Individual, Corporate, and Student Membership may be granted to any individual or organization that supports the Foundation's mission and purpose, is in good standing subject to our Code of Ethics, and pays the dues as set by the Board of Directors. The Foundation may, at its discretion, offer monthly, annual, two-year, and Lifetime memberships. Regional pricing is available to all paid membership classes.

Complimentary Membership may be offered on an opt-in and automated basis to the top 5 active leaders of any chapter, project, event, or committee that supports the Foundation's mission and purpose, is in good standing subject to our Code of Ethics, and has been in the top 5 position continuously for six months prior to applying for complimentary membership. Complimentary Membership is valid for one year. Leaders do not need to accept any offer of complementary leadership. Complementary members in good standing for 12 months may stand for the Board, but if elected, must maintain good standing with paid Membership. Directors who are eligible through the above criteria must not accept Complimentary Membership during their term and maintain good standing with paid Membership.

Distinguished Lifetime Membership is an award that shall be determined and approved solely by a majority vote of the Board of Directors for long-standing and extraordinary services to the OWASP Community, and can be granted to any participant or member who meets criteria as adopted by the Board from time to time. Distinguished Lifetime Membership is equivalent to Lifetime Individual Membership, and will take the place of any existing membership on record. This award does not entitle the receipient to a partial or full refund of any existing membership.

All membership classes are eligible to vote in elections.

If an individual is a sanctioned individual or resides in a sanctioned country under US Government laws or regulations, the Foundation will either decline to grant membership, or revoke membership and participation if the individual is a member. For more details, please consult the Appendix.

### SECTION 4.03 Termination of Membership

The Board of Directors, by affirmative vote of two thirds of all members of the Board, may suspend or expel a member, and may, by a majority vote of those present at any regularly constituted meeting, terminate, suspend or expel the membership of any member who becomes ineligible for membership.

### SECTION 4.03a Resumption of Terminated Membership and Activities

The Board of Directors, by the affirmative vote of two-thirds of all members of the Board, may reinstate a Terminated Member to permit full participation in all OWASP activities, chapters, projects, events, committees, and duties, including OWASP Leadership and paid membership.

### SECTION 4.04 Resignation

Any member may resign by filing a written resignation with the Secretary; however, such resignation shall not relieve the member so resigning of the obligation to pay any dues or other charges theretofore accrued and unpaid.

### SECTION 4.05 Dues

Dues for members shall be established by the Board of Directors.

### SECTION 4.06 Voting

Each member shall be entitled to vote on designated matters. The affirmative vote of a majority of the members or by proxy shall be the act of the members as a whole unless a greater number of members is required by law or stated otherwise in these Bylaws.

### SECTION 4.07 Participation

Participation in OWASP activities (events, meetings, activities, mailings lists, projects, etc.) does not require OWASP membership but is subject to adherence to the OWASP Core Values, Code of Conduct, and all approved policies.

Participation may be revoked by an OWASP Leader, the OWASP Foundation, or the relevant Committee for breaching our values, Code of Conduct, or an approved policy. Notification of such revocation must be made to the individual in writing, with the OWASP Board of Directors copied in order for updating the Foundation’s records.

Participants, if they feel revocation of their participation is unjustified, may appeal this decision using the Appeals provisions in this bylaws document.

## ARTICLE V - ADVISORY BOARDS, COMMITTEES AND LOCAL CHAPTERS

### SECTION 5.01 Committees

Establishment. The Board of Directors may, by resolution adopted by a majority of the Directors in office, establish one or more Board sub-committees (e.g, fundraising, finance, audit, or executive), Advisory Boards, or Committees. These will be subject to compliance with the core purpose and core values as outlined in Sections 1.02 and 1.03. Committees are formed and governed by the Committees Policy, and are limited the Charter's purpose and scope. As a Committee Charter might devolve powers currently held by the Board or the Foundation to the Committee, any such devolution to a Committee will require a 2/3rd majority vote.

### SECTION 5.02 Local Chapters

A local OWASP chapter may establish smaller, local chapters within the geographical boundary of a chapter, such as country or a city. The bylaws of a chapter must not contain anything that is at variance with the expressed purposes of the OWASP Foundation or with the OWASP Foundation Bylaws, and must be approved as specified by the OWASP Foundation Board of Directors before becoming effective. A chapter may not change its bylaws, its name, or its boundaries without approval as specified by the OWASP Foundation. Chapter Bylaws may be produced in the native language of a nation, but must be translated into English for submission to the OWASP Foundation.

Local chapter leadership has to manage the local chapter according to the policies defined in the latest approved Chapter Policy. The OWASP Foundation may, by affirmative vote of a majority of the Board of Directors, suspend or annul a chapter if, in the judgment of the Board of Directors, such action is in the best interests of the OWASP Foundation.

## ARTICLE VI - INDEMNITY

### SECTION 6.01 Indemnity

The Foundation shall indemnify the Officers of the Foundation including International Board Members and Employees, or agents as follows:

1. Every Officer, Board Member, and employee of the Foundation shall be indemnified by the Foundation against all expenses and liabilities, including counsel fees, reasonably incurred by or imposed upon them in connection with any proceeding to which they may be made a party, or in which they may become involved, by reason of being or having been a director, officer, employee or agent of the Foundation or is or was serving at the request of the Foundation as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Foundation, partnership, joint venture, trust or enterprise, or any settlement thereof, whether or not they are a director, officer, employee or agent at the time such expenses are incurred, except in such cases wherein the director, officer, employee or agent is adjudged guilty of willful misfeasance or malfeasance in the performance of their duties; provided that in the event of a settlement the indemnification herein shall apply only when the Board of Directors approves such settlement and reimbursement as being in the best interests of the Foundation.
2. The Foundation shall provide to any person who is or was an officer, board member, or employee, or agent of the Foundation or is or was serving at the request of the Foundation as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Foundation, partnership, joint venture, trust or enterprise, the indemnity against expenses of suit, litigation or other proceedings which is specifically permissible under applicable law.
3. The Board of Directors may, in its discretion, direct the purchase of liability insurance by way of implementing the provisions of this Article VI.

### SECTION 7.01 Conflict defined

A conflict of interest may exist when any director, officer, or staff member may be seen as having interests which are adverse to the interests of the Foundation.

### SECTION 7.02 Disclosure required

Any conflict of interest shall be disclosed to the Board of Directors by the person concerned. When any conflict of interest is relevant to a matter requiring action by the Board of Directors, the interested person shall call it to the attention of the Board of Directors or its appropriate committee and such person shall not vote on the matter; provided however, any Director disclosing a possible conflict of interest may be counted in determining the presence of a quorum at a meeting of the Board of Directors or a committee thereof.

### SECTION 7.03 Absence from discussion

The person having the conflict shall not participate in the decision regarding the matter under consideration.

### SECTION 7.04 Minutes

The minutes of the meeting of the Board or committee shall reflect that the conflict of interest was disclosed and that the interested person did not vote.

### SECTION 7.05 Annual review

A copy of this conflict of interest statement shall be furnished to each director, officer, and staff member who is presently serving the Foundation, or who may hereafter become associated with the Foundation.
