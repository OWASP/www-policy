## ARTICLE III - BOARD OF DIRECTORS

### SECTION 3.01 General Powers and Authority

The business and affairs of the Foundation shall be managed by its Board of Directors

### SECTION 3.02 Number, Tenure, and Qualifications

The number of directors of the Foundation shall be no less than five and no more than seven. Each director shall hold office for two years unless duly removed. An individual is limited to four (4) consecutive two (2) year terms effective January 1, 2014. Each director must be elected as prescribed in the election policy and procedure. An individual is limited to no more than two (2) terms in a ten (10) year period.

### SECTION 3.03 Regular Meetings

The Board of Directors shall have regular meetings as needed. A link to the board meeting agenda’s and the historical minutes is here: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Board_Meetings. Meetings shall be at such dates, times, and places as the Board shall determine in December of the preceding year and as amended by the Board. In no event will there be less than one meeting per quarter. These meetings will be open to public attendance, however, certain portions of the meeting may be closed to board members and their delegates when required for legal reasons, or to shield liability, or to handle personnel issues, or similar.

Attendance in person or virtually by board members is required at no less than 75% of the total meetings each year and shall be highly encouraged to meet in person at least once annually at a date to be announced and agreed upon. To be considered as “attended” the board member must attend at least 90% of the meeting, starting at the published scheduled time until the published end time or the meeting is adjourned (whichever is earlier). Attendance is tabulated by the Executive Director or delegate within seven days after every scheduled meeting for the purpose of determining if the 75% attendance requirement has been met, and the tabulation is based upon the entire calendar year. Cancelled meetings are considered attended for the purposes of the tabulation. Failure by a board member to meet the 75% attendance requirement after any tabulation will cause a mandatory vote of confidence by the remaining board members, whose votes will be publicly recorded. The vote of confidence is to take place within 21 days, but not sooner than 7 days, of notification by the Executive Director or delegate that a board member has not met the attendance threshold. During the first seven days, the board member in question will have an opportunity to make their case to their fellow board members. The vote of confidence will take place on the OWASP Board of Directors email list, unless the Board votes to review the matter at their next meeting, so long as the next meeting occurs within the 21­day window. An overall vote of “no confidence” is recorded if more than half of the board members vote for it, which causes the board member in question to be instantly removed from their seat on the board. Vacancies on the board are handled as per SECTION 3.10.

### SECTION 3.04 Special Meetings

Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be called by or at the request of the Chairman or any two (2) directors. The person or persons authorized to call special meetings of the Board of Directors may fix the place for holding any special meeting of the Board of Directors called by them.

### SECTION 3.05 Notice of Special Meetings

A special meeting may be called by the Chairman or at the request of any two (2) Board members by notice emailed, telephone, or telegraphed to each Board member not less one week before such meetings. Any directors may waive notice of any meeting. The attendance of a director at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except where a director attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.

### SECTION 3.06 Quorum

A majority of the number of Directors fixed by ### SECTION 2 of this Article shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at any meeting of the Board of Directors. If less than such majority is present at a meeting, a majority of the Directors present may adjourn the meeting from time to time without further notice. All decisions will be made by majority vote of those present at a meeting at which a quorum is present. If a board of Directors vote results in a split decision, the Chairman of the Board, if present at the meeting, can decide the issue.

### SECTION 3.07 Participation in Meeting by Conference Telephone

Members of the Board may participate in a meeting through use of conference telephone or similar communication equipment, so long as members participating in such meeting can hear one another. A quorum must be maintained at all times during the meeting or the meeting will not continue.

### SECTION 3.08 Manner of Acting

The act of the majority of the directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the Board of Directors.

### SECTION 3.09 Action Without a Meeting

Any action that may be taken by the Board of Directors at a meeting may be taken without a meeting if consent in writing, setting forth the action so to be taken, shall be agreed to before such action by a majority of the directors. Such consent can be provided by email.

### SECTION 3.10 Vacancies

Any vacancy occurring in the Board of Directors may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors though less than a quorum of the Board of Directors, unless otherwise provided by law. If there is an equal number of affirmative and negative votes then the ultimate determination shall be made by the then­ sitting Chairman of the Board. A director elected to fill a vacancy shall be elected for the unexpired term of his predecessor in office. Any directorship to be filled by reason of an increase in the number of directors may be filled by election by the Board of Directors for a term of office continuing only until the next election of directors by the Directors.

### SECTION 3.11 Employment

No paid employee can serve on the Board of Directors or in the role of Officer while they are employed in a paid position by the Foundation.

### SECTION 3.12 Reimbursement

Directors shall serve without compensation with the exception that expenses incurred in the furtherance of he Foundation's business are allowed to be reimbursed with documentation and prior approval according to the Reimbursement Policy.

### SECTION 3.13 Presumption of Assent

A Director of the Foundation who is present at a meeting of the Board of Directors at which action on any corporate matter is taken shall be presumed to have assented to the action taken unless his or her dissent shall be entered in the minutes of the meeting or unless s/he shall file his or her written dissent to such action with the person acting as the Secretary of the meeting before the adjournment thereof, or shall forward such dissent to the Secretary of the Foundation immediately after the adjournment of the meeting.
