## Section 3.2 Annual Meeting

Annual meetings of Members ordinarily shall be held by written consent pursuant to Section 3.10. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, the Board of Directors may call any annual meeting to be held in person at such date and time as shall be designated from time to time by the Board of Directors or the Chairperson of the Board of Directors (the "Chair").

Special meetings of the Members, for any purpose or purposes, may, unless otherwise prescribed by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation, be called by the Board of Directors, the Executive Director, or the Secretary at the request in writing of a majority of the Directors then in office, or at the request in writing of Voting Members entitled to vote at least ten percent of the aggregate votes of all Voting Members.

Upon request by any person or persons entitled to call a special meeting of the Voting Members, the Executive Director, the Chairperson of the Board of Directors (the "Chairperson") (if any), the Vice-Chair, or the Secretary shall cause notice to be given within thirty days of receipt of such request.

## Section 3.4 Notice of Meetings

Except as otherwise provided by law or these By-laws, a notice of each meeting of the Members, annual or special, stating the place, if any, date and hour of the meeting, the means of remote communication, if any, by which Members may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting, and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called, shall be given not less than ten or more than sixty days before the date of the meeting, to each Member entitled to attend such meeting.

## Section 3.5 Voting List

The Officer (defined in Section 6.1) who has charge of the system of record for the Foundation shall prepare, at least ten days before every meeting of Members, a complete list of the Members entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each such Member. Nothing contained in this Section shall require the Foundation to include electronic mail addresses or other electronic contact information on such list. Such list shall be open to the examination of any Member, for any purpose germane to the meeting, for a period of at least 10 days prior to the meeting: (i) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the meeting, or (ii) during ordinary business hours, at the principal place of business of the Foundation. If the Foundation determines to make the list available on an electronic network, the Foundation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to Members of the Foundation. If the meeting is to be held at a place, then the list shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any Member who is present. If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, then the list shall also be open to the examination of any Member during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting.

## Section 3.6 Quorum

Except as otherwise provided by statute, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-laws, Voting Members entitled to vote more than ten percent of the aggregate votes of all Voting Members (or such higher percentage of Voting Members as may be required by law, these By-laws or the Certificate of Incorporation, to approve any action to be taken at such meeting), present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the Members for the transaction of business. Member Committees shall have the same rules relating to quorum requirements and voting majorities as provided for in these By-laws, unless otherwise approved by the affirmative vote of the Board of Directors, except as otherwise proved by statute, the Certificate of Incorporation, or these By-laws.

## Section 3.7 Adjournments

Any meeting of Members may be adjourned from time to time without notice to any other time and to any other place, if any, at which a meeting of Members may be held under these By-laws, which time and place, if any, thereof, and the means of remote communications, if any, by which Members may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such adjourned meeting shall be announced at the meeting by a majority of the Voting Members present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at such meeting (regardless of whether a quorum is present), or, if no Voting Member is present or represented by proxy, by any officer entitled to preside at or to act as Secretary of such meeting, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present or represented. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than thirty days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to all Members entitled to vote at the meeting.

## Section 3.8 Action at Meetings

(a)	When a quorum is present at any meeting of Members, in all matters other than the election of the Board of Directors, the vote of more than fifty percent of the aggregate votes of all Voting Members, present in person or represented by proxy at such meeting and entitled to vote on the question, shall decide any question brought before such meeting, unless the question is one upon which, by express provision of law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-laws, a different vote is required, in which case such express provision shall govern and control the decision of such question.  Members of the Board of Directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes of the Voting Members present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote thereon in accordance with the Elections Policy.

(b)	Notwithstanding Section 3.8(a), in all matters other than the election of the Board of Directors, in the event that any vote is to be taken of a single class of Voting Members, then a quorum for such vote shall be not less than ten percent of the Voting Members of that class, and when such quorum is present, the vote of more than fifty percent of the aggregate votes of the Voting Members of that class present in person or represented by proxy at such meeting and entitled to vote on the question, shall decide such question.  

(c) In the event that the Voting Members shall desire to take any action that they are permitted to take by these By-laws, the Certificate of Incorporation or applicable law, and such action would, by provision of these By-laws or any resolution adopted by the Board of Directors, require a Super Majority Vote of the Board of Directors were such action to be taken by the Board of Directors, then the quorum required for such action shall be as specified in Section 3.6 above, and the taking of such action by the Voting Members shall require the affirmative vote of a majority of all Voting Members, present in person or represented by proxy at such meeting and entitled to vote on the question.

## Section 3.9 Proxies

Each Member entitled to vote at a meeting of Members, or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, may authorize another person or persons to act for the Member by proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. Without limiting the manner in which a Member may authorize another person or persons to act for such Member as proxy pursuant to this Section, the following shall constitute valid means by which a Member may grant such authority:

(a) A Member may execute a writing authorizing another person or persons to act for such Member as proxy. Execution may be accomplished by the Member or such Member’s authorized officer, director, employee or agent signing such writing or causing such person's signature to be affixed to such writing by any reasonable means including, but not limited to, by facsimile signature.

(b) A Member may authorize another person or persons to act for such Member as proxy by transmitting or authorizing an electronic transmission to the person who will be the holder of the proxy or to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service organization or like agent duly authorized by the person who will be the holder of the proxy to receive such transmission, provided that any such electronic transmission must either set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be determined that the electronic transmission was authorized by the Member. If it is determined that such electronic transmissions are valid, the inspectors or, if there are no inspectors, such other persons making that determination shall specify the information upon which they relied.

## Section 3.10 Action Without Meeting

Any action required to be taken at any annual or special meeting of Members, or any action which may be taken at any annual or special meeting of a Member Committee, Sub-Group (defined in Section 5.5(b) below) thereof, or other group of Members or subset of Members, may be taken without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent in writing, setting forth the action to be taken, shall be signed by Members (or members of a class of Members, as the case may be) making up not less than that percentage of all Members as would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all Members (or class of Members, as the case may be) entitled to vote thereon were present and voted. Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those otherwise entitled to vote thereon who have not consented in writing.

An electronic transmission consenting to an action to be taken and transmitted by a Member or proxyholder, or by a person or persons authorized to act for a Member or proxyholder, shall be deemed to be written and signed for the purposes of this Section, provided that any such electronic transmission sets forth or is delivered with information from which the Foundation can determine (A) that the electronic transmission was transmitted by the Member or proxyholder or by a person or persons authorized to act for the Member or proxyholder and (B) the date on which such Member or proxyholder or authorized person or persons transmitted such electronic transmission.

A consent given by electronic transmission is delivered to the Foundation upon the earliest of: (i) when the consent enters and information processing system, if any, designated by the Foundation for receiving consents, so long as the electronic transmission is in a form capable of being processed by that system and the Foundation is able to retrieve that electronic transmission; (ii) when a paper reproduction of the consent is delivered to the Foundation's principal place of business or an officer or agent of the Foundation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of Members are recorded; (iii) when a paper reproduction of the consent is delivered to the Foundation's registered office in the State of Delaware by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested; or (iv) when delivered in such other manner, if any, provided by resolution of the Board of Directors of the Foundation. A consent given by electronic transmission is delivered under this provision even if no person is aware of its receipt. Receipt of an electronic acknowledgment from an information processing system establishes that consent given by electronic transmission was received but, by itself, does not establish that the content sent corresponds to the content received.

Any copy, facsimile, or other reliable reproduction of a document (including any electronic transmission) may be substituted or used in lieu of the original document for all purposes for which the original document could be used, provided that such copy, facsimile, or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original document.

## Section 3.11 Action Held by Remote Communication

If authorized by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion, and subject to such guidelines and procedures as the Board of Directors may adopt, Members not physically present at a meeting of Members may, by means of remote communication: (A) participate in a meeting of Members; and (B) be deemed present in person and vote at a meeting of Members whether such meeting is to be held at a designated place or solely by means of remote communication, provided that (i) the Foundation shall implement reasonable measures to verify that each person deemed present and permitted to vote at the meeting by means of remote communication is a Member or proxyholder, (ii) the Foundation shall implement reasonable measures to provide such Members and proxyholders a reasonable opportunity to participate in the meeting and to vote on matters submitted to the Members, including an opportunity to read or hear the proceedings of the meeting substantially concurrently with such proceedings, and (iii) if any Member votes or takes other action at the meeting by means of remote communication, a record of such vote or other action shall be maintained by the Foundation.

## Section 3.12 Nomination and Election Procedures

Subject to the provisions of Section 4.3, the Board of Directors shall establish a reasonable nomination and election policy given the nature, size, and operations of the Foundation, including a reasonable means for Members of appropriate classes to nominate a person for election as a Director, a reasonable opportunity for a nominee to communicate to the Members the nominee's qualifications and the reasons for the nominee's candidacy (if requested by such nominee), a reasonable opportunity for all nominees to solicit votes (if requested by any such nominee), and a reasonable opportunity for all Members entitled to vote thereon to choose among the nominees.

## Section 3.13 Order of Business

Any records administered by or on behalf of the Foundation in the regular course of its business, including its Membership list, books of account, and minute books, may be kept on, or by means of, or be in the form of, any information storage device, method, or one or more electronic networks or databases (including one or more distributed electronic networks or databases), provided that the records so kept can be converted into clearly legible paper form within a reasonable time. The Foundation shall convert any records so kept into clearly legible paper form upon the request of any person entitled to inspect such records pursuant to any provision of the DGCL. When records are kept in such manner, a clearly legible paper form prepared from or by means of the information storage device, method or one or more electronic networks or databases (including one or more distributed electronic networks or databases) shall be valid and admissible in evidence, and accepted for all other purposes, to the same extent as an original paper record of the same information would have been, provided the paper form accurately portrays the record.

## Section 13.5 Document Form, Signature and Delivery

Without limiting the way any act or transaction may be documented, or the way a document may be signed or delivered:

(a) Any act or transaction contemplated or governed by the DGCL or the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-laws may be provided for in a document, and an electronic transmission shall be deemed the equivalent of a written document. "Document" means (i) any tangible medium on which information is inscribed, and includes handwritten, typed, printed or similar instruments, and copies of such instruments and (ii) an electronic transmission

(b) Whenever the DGCL or the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-laws requires or permits a signature, the signature may be a manual, facsimile, conformed or electronic signature. "Electronic signature" means an electronic symbol or process that is attached to, or logically associated with, a document and executed or adopted by a person with an intent to authenticate or adopt the document

(c) Unless otherwise agreed between the sender and recipient, an electronic transmission shall be deemed delivered to a person for purposes of the DGCL and the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws when it enters an information processing system that the person has designated for the purpose of receiving electronic transmissions of the type delivered, so long as the electronic transmission is in a form capable of being processed by that system and such person is able to retrieve the electronic transmission. An electronic transmission is delivered under this Section even if no person is aware of its receipt. Receipt of an electronic acknowledgement from an information processing system establishes that an electronic transmission was received but, by itself, does not establish that the content sent corresponds to the content received

This provision shall not prohibit one or more persons from conducting a transaction in accordance with any electronic signature rules so long as the part or parts of the transaction that are governed by the DGCL are documented, signed, and delivered in accordance with this Section or otherwise in accordance with the DGCL. This Section shall apply solely for purposes of determining whether an act or transaction has been documented, and the document has been signed and delivered, in accordance with the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation and these By-laws.

# ARTICLE XIV - ANTITRUST COMPLIANCE

## Section 14.1 General

The Foundation will conduct all its activities in conformance with all international, US federal and state antitrust laws, including the Sherman Act, the Clayton Act, the Robinson-Patman Act, and the Federal Trade Commission Act. The Board of Directors and the Executive Director shall consult legal counsel and seek legal review whenever necessary to insure that the activities of the Foundation are conducted in conformance with such laws.

## Section 14.2 Availability of Intellectual Property

It is the good faith objective of the Foundation (i) to make all Intellectual Property available as soon as its development and adoption by the Foundation is complete on the same terms to all Members who have not participated in the development or determination of such Intellectual Property as well as to all those Members who have participated, (ii) to make all such Intellectual Property available at the same point in time to all Members, and (iii) to make all such Intellectual Property available to all non-Members on fair and reasonable terms and conditions.

## Section 14.3 No Obligation to Endorse

No Member shall, by reason of its Membership or participation in the Foundation or otherwise, be obligated to license from the Foundation, use or endorse any Intellectual Property (as defined in Section 2.5) developed or endorsed by the Foundation, or to conform any of its products to any Specification or standard developed or adopted by the Foundation, nor shall any such Member be precluded from independently licensing, using or endorsing similar intellectual property, software, specifications or documentation developed by it or by others.

# ARTICLE XV - AMENDMENTS

Except where such power is expressly limited by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-laws as to any specific action, these By-laws may be altered, amended or repealed, and new By-laws may be adopted, in each case by an affirmative vote of (i) a Super Majority of the Board of Directors or (ii) a majority of Voting Members then in good standing in accordance with Section 3.8(c) of these By-laws, at any annual meeting of the Voting Members or regular meeting of the Board of Directors or at any special meeting of the Voting Members or of the Board of Directors, provided, however, that in the case of a regular or special meeting of Voting Members, notice of such alteration, amendment, repeal or adoption of new By-laws shall be contained in the notice of such meeting.
