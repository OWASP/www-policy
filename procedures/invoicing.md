## Changing Invoice

Stripe does not allow invoices which have been finalized/sent to be changed. Not the amount, not the date, not the items. This seems to make a good deal of sense for auditing purposes. If an invoice was sent in error, or it contains errors you must:

1. VOID the invoice in Stripe and include a reason in the note field
2. Download a PDF of the VOIDED invoice 
3. Email the PDF to accounting@owasp.com, kelly.santalucia@owasp.com
4. Create a new invoice with the process above

## Payment made to the Wrong Invoice

1. Create a note on the paid invoice of overpayment and which invoice overage will be apply to.
2. Open the invoice to which the payment was to be made and issue a CREDIT NOTE
3. Include the paid invoice reference number
2. Download a PDF of the paid invoice 
3. Email the PDF to accounting@owasp.com, kelly.santalucia@owasp.com
