layout: col-sidebar

---
Version 2019-11-01 - Final

This handbook was developed to provide you with guidelines to our company policies and to outline programs and benefits available to you. You should familiarize yourself with the contents as soon as possible so you will know what is expected of you and what you can expect from our organization.

This Employee Handbook replaces all previous The OWASP Foundation handbooks, policies and memoranda. Failure to follow any of the policies in this handbook may result in disciplinary action, up to and including, termination of employment.

The OWASP Foundation and Insperity are in a co-employment work relationship. This means that The OWASP Foundation handles the day-to-day activities related to its core business.  Insperity handles the administrative responsibilities such as payroll processing and benefits, and supports the company in many human resources issues. 

You should have already signed an Employment Agreement outlining your employment relationship with Insperity. Contact your supervisor or an Insperity payroll or human resource specialist if you have any questions.

We hope that your experience with us will be challenging, enjoyable and rewarding. Again, welcome!

# EMPLOYMENT

<a name="employment-applications"></a>
## EMPLOYMENT APPLICATIONS

The company relies on the accuracy of the information you provide during the employment hiring process. We also expect that you and your references give accurate and true information during the hiring process and employment. If we find that any information is misleading, false, or was left out on purpose, we may reject an applicant from further consideration. If the person was already hired, it could result in termination of employment. 

When we process an employment application, we may obtain a background report. If we take an adverse employment action based in whole or in part on the background report, a copy of the report will be given to you so that you can take appropriate steps.

<a name="offer-letters"></a>
## OFFER LETTERS

As part of our hiring processes, your offer of employment was made through an offer letter.  This letter fully and wholly outlines your employment offer with the company. The conditions of your offer are confidential. If you ever change positions with the company you will be presented with an offer letter.

Offer letters have an expiration date and if left not accepted by the expiration date, the company withdraws it’s offer of employment.  If accepted, a copy should be signed and will be placed in your Personnel file.  Conditions of employment are confidential and may not be disclosed to third parties, except for disclosures in accordance with applicable law.

<a name="salary-administration"></a>
## SALARY ADMINISTRATION

The company has a salary administration program which helps us have consistent pay practices, comply with federal and state laws, support our commitment to Equal Employment Opportunity, and offer competitive salaries within our labor market.  We are committed to paying equitable wages that are based on the requirements and responsibilities of each job.

Compensation for each job is based on several factors. The factors include job analysis and evaluation, the essential duties and responsibilities of the job, and salary survey data (how other employers pay their employees). We periodically review our salary administration program and change it as necessary. 

We may give merit-based pay adjustments to some employees to recognize superior employee performance. These adjustments are based on a number of factors including the information documented by the formal performance evaluations. We may give incentive bonuses depending on each employee's individual contributions to the organization.  

If you have a question about compensation in your area or for your job, talk with your supervisor.

<a name="performance-evaluation"></a>
## PERFORMANCE EVALUATION

We encourage you and your supervisor to discuss job performance and goals on an informal, day-to-day basis. You and your supervisor will have formal performance evaluations to discuss your work and goals, to identify and correct weaknesses, and to encourage and recognize your strengths. 

Performance evaluations will be done at the beginning of each calendar year and will be completed by the end of each January. Adjustments to compensation or merit increases, if any, will be applied to the February payroll.

<a name="progressive-discipline"></a>
## PROGRESSIVE DISCIPLINE

This policy describes the policy for administering fair and consistent discipline for unsatisfactory conduct at the company.

We believe it is important to make sure that all employees are treated fairly and that disciplinary actions are prompt, consistent, and impartial. The major purpose of a disciplinary action is to correct the problem, prevent it from happening again, and prepare the employee for satisfactory performance in the future. 

Although your employment is based on mutual consent and both you and the company have the right to terminate employment at will, with or without cause or advance notice, company may use progressive discipline at it discretion.

Disciplinary action may be any of the following four steps: 1) verbal warning, 2) written warning, 3) suspension with or without pay, or 4) termination of employment. We will look at how severe the problem is and how often it has happened when deciding which step to take. There may be circumstances when one or more steps are bypassed.

In most cases, progressive discipline means that we will normally take these steps in the following order: 1) a first offense may call for a verbal warning; 2) a next offense may be followed by a written warning; 3) another offense may lead to a suspension; and, 4) still another offense may then lead to termination of employment.

In very serious situations, some types of employee problems may justify either a suspension, or, in extreme situations, termination of employment, without going through the usual progressive discipline steps. 

You should also look at the Employee Conduct in this handbook. That policy lists examples of unacceptable conduct that might result in immediate suspension or termination of employment. However, some of the examples of unsatisfactory conduct listed may result in the progressive discipline process described above instead of immediate suspension or termination.

By using progressive discipline, we hope that most employee problems can be corrected at an early stage, benefiting both the employee and the company.

<a name="at-will-employment"></a>
## AT-WILL EMPLOYMENT

Your employment with The OWASP Foundation is at-will which means that you or The OWASP Foundation may terminate your employment at any time for any lawful reason unless a written employment agreement exists with The OWASP Foundation that provides otherwise. Your employment with Insperity is at-will regardless of whether you have a written employment agreement with The OWASP Foundation.   

The OWASP Foundation has the right to transfer, demote, or otherwise discipline an employee at any time for any lawful reason. Insperity does not have the authority to change your at-will status with The OWASP Foundation, enter into any agreement for employment for any specified period or make any promises or commitments to the contrary. Likewise, The OWASP Foundation does not have the authority to change your at-will status with Insperity, enter into any agreements on behalf of Insperity for employment for any specified period or make any promises or commitments to the contrary. The OWASP Foundation however, maintains the ability to enter into employment agreements, independent of Insperity, which is not binding on Insperity and does not alter the at-will nature of your employment with Insperity. For an employment agreement with The OWASP Foundation to be considered valid, it must be signed by the Managing Member. 

This handbook is not a contract guaranteeing employment for any specific duration. As provided in the Handbook Acknowledgment, nothing in this handbook creates or is intended to create a promise or representation of continued employment. This handbook replaces any and all prior handbooks, written documents (with the exception of authorized employment agreements) or oral or implied representations that might otherwise contradict the at-will nature of your employment.

<a name="outside-employment"></a>
## OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT
You may hold an outside job as long as you can satisfactorily perform your OWASP job and the job is not in a related competitive field or company.  The job also must not interfere with our scheduling demands.

We hold all employees to the same performance standards and scheduling expectations regardless if they have other jobs. In order to remain employed at the company, we will ask you to terminate an outside job if we determine that it is impacting your performance or your ability to meet our requirements, which may change over time.

If your outside employment has an undesirable impact on the company, we will consider that it is a conflict of interest.

<a name="change-in-pay"></a>
## CHANGE IN POLICY

The company may change, revoke or supplement the policies in this handbook at any time without notice. The company will determine the effective date of any changes and every effort will be made to notify you in advance. However, failure to give advance notice will not void any policy’s application in the workplace.

Supervisors do not have the authority to change the policies in this handbook on their own. If you are uncertain about any policy or procedure, contact your supervisor for clarification.

<a name="personnel-files"></a>
## PERSONNEL FILES

The OWASP Foundation and Insperity each maintain a personnel file on each employee. Contact your supervisor to request a review of your company personnel file, or contact your Insperity payroll or human resource specialist to view your Insperity personnel file.

To ensure that your personnel file is up-to-date at all times, notify your supervisor or your payroll specialist of any changes in your name, telephone number, home address, withholding instructions, number of dependents, beneficiary designations, or the individuals to notify in case of an emergency. Additionally, complete and forward an Employee Change of Personal Information form to your Insperity payroll specialist or you may update your file through the Insperity PremierTM at http://portal.insperity.com. Assistance may also be provided through the Insperity Contact Center at 866-715-3552, 7AM-7PM CT Monday-Friday.

<a name="employment-references"></a>
## EMPLOYMENT REFERENCES

Requests for employment verifications for current or former employees, should be directed to Insperity’s Contact Center at 866-715-3552, option 5.  Insperity will only release your last title and dates of employment, unless you have authorized in writing certain additional information to be provided.

<a name="equal-employment-opportunity"></a>
## EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY

The OWASP Foundation and Insperity provide equal employment opportunities to all employees and applicants in all company facilities without regard to race, color, religious creed, sex, national origin, ancestry, citizenship status, pregnancy, childbirth, (or related medical conditions, including, but not limited to lactation), physical disability, mental and/or intellectual disability, age, military status or status as a Vietnam-era or special disabled veteran, marital status, registered domestic partner or civil union status, gender (including sex stereotyping and gender identity or expression), medical condition (including, but not limited to, cancer related or HIV/AIDS related), genetic information, or sexual orientation in accordance with applicable federal, state and local laws. 

This policy applies to all terms and conditions of employment, including, but not limited to, hiring, placement, promotion, termination, layoff, recall, transfer, leaves of absence, compensation and training.

<a name="immigration-law compliance"></a>
## IMMIGRATION LAW COMPLIANCE

For our domestic United States operations, the company is committed to employing only people who are United States citizens or who are aliens legally authorized to work in the United States. We do not illegally discriminate because of a person's citizenship or national origin.

Because we comply with the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, every new employee at OWASP is required to complete the Employment Eligibility Verification Form I-9 and show documents that prove identity and employment eligibility.

If you leave the company and are rehired to our domestic U.S. operations, you must complete another Form I-9 if the previous I-9 with company is more than three years old, or if the original I-9 is not accurate anymore, or if we no longer have the original I-9.

If you ask questions or want to discuss our Immigration Compliance policy you may do so without fear of reprisal or retaliation or be punished in any way.

<a name="non-disclosure"></a>
## NON-DISCLOSURE

It is very important to the company that we protect our confidential business information and trade secrets. Confidential information includes, but is not limited to, the following examples:

* compensation data 
* computer processes 
* customer lists 
* membership lists
* customer preferences 
* financial information 
* pending projects and proposals 
* other confidential information shared with staff or contractors

As part of your employment agreement you signed a non-disclosure agreement as a condition of your employment.

If you improperly use or disclose a trade secret or confidential business information, you will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment and legal action. This applies even if you do not get any benefit from releasing the information.

<a name="accommodation-of-disabilities"></a>
## ACCOMMODATION OF DISABILITIES

The OWASP Foundation is committed to making every reasonable effort to accommodate an employee’s disability. An accommodation may be provided as long as the employee can perform the essential duties of the job, and it does not create an undue hardship for the company.  A reasonable accommodation may include changes in the work environment or in the way a job is performed, so a person with a disability may enjoy equal employment opportunities.

Under this policy, if you are pregnant and request a reasonable accommodation for the duration of or any part of your pregnancy, we will explore all possible means of providing the reasonable accommodation including, but is not limited to, the following:

* More frequent or longer bathroom breaks;
* Breaks for increased water intake;
* Breaks for periodic rest;
* Seating;
* Assistance with manual labor;
* Light duty;
* Temporary transfer to a less strenuous or hazardous position;
* Acquisition or modification of equipment;
* Changing the employee’s job duties;
* Changing the employee’s work hours;
* Relocating the employee’s work area; or
* Providing leave necessitated by pregnancy, childbirth, or medical or common conditions relating to pregnancy or childbirth.

Accommodations depend upon the employee’s job qualifications and the specific facts and circumstances of each individual situation. Please inform your supervisor if you require an accommodation, so the company can have an interactive discussion with you. Your supervisor will work with you to determine if there is a need for an adjustment or change at work to accommodate your disability.

<a name="employment-termination"></a>
## EMPLOYMENT TERMINATION

There can be many reasons why employment may terminate. We will usually schedule an exit interview if you terminate. At the exit interview, we can go over such topics as your benefits, benefits conversion rights, repayment of any outstanding debt to OWASP or return of company-owned property. You may also make suggestions or complaints and ask questions at the exit interview. 

Your benefits are affected by termination in several ways. All accrued, vested benefits that are due and payable at termination will be paid out. You may be allowed to continue some benefits by paying for them yourself. You will be notified in writing about which benefits you can continue and the limitations and details of how to continue them.

<a name="employee-conduct"></a>

<a name="ethics"></a>
## ETHICS

The OWASP Foundation is committed to providing a work environment governed by the highest ethical and legal standards. In all situations you are expected to conduct your activities with integrity, ethically and in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.  As an employee you are expected to model the OWASP Foundation Code of Ethics in your interactions with our community.

Part of maintaining an ethical workplace is providing employees the opportunity to provide honest feedback. The company will not tolerate retaliation of any kind against an employee who reports in good faith a violation of law or of this policy.

The OWASP Foundation encourages you to report any actual or potential violations of applicable laws or regulations and any unethical, dishonest or improper conduct to your supervisor, the president/CEO or The OWASP Foundation’s Human Resources Department.

# HOURS AND COMPENSATION

<a name="paydays"></a>
## PAYDAYS

All employees are paid Monthly on the last business day of each month. Each paycheck includes pay for all work performed through the current pay period. If a payday falls on a holiday, you will be paid on the last work day before that payday. 

The company has a direct deposit program. If you provide written authorization, we will deposit your pay directly into your bank account. On paydays, instead a check, you will get a statement of earnings and deductions. Your first paycheck will be a live check mailed to your home address. This is a security procedure for new hires implemented by Insperity. Please note, while we will make our best efforts to expedite your payroll to you as soon as possible, your first paycheck may be delayed until the 10th day of your second month of employment.

If your position qualifies for Incentive Compensation or Commissions, please see your supervisor for additional information about those programs.

If your employment ends, you will be paid your final wages in accordance with applicable state law.

<a name="error-in-pay"></a>
## ERROR IN PAY

The OWASP Foundation and Insperity make every effort to ensure that you receive the correct amount of pay in each paycheck and that you are paid on the scheduled payday.  

You should review your paycheck when received and, if you believe an error has been made, contact your supervisor and Insperity human resource specialist immediately. All necessary steps will be taken to research the problem and to assure that any necessary correction is promptly made.

<a name="exempt-employee-reduction-of-salary"></a>
## EXEMPT EMPLOYEE REDUCTION OF SALARY

Exempt employees are paid on a salary basis and, in general, must be paid their full salary for any week they perform work. Their weekly salary may be reduced only in the following circumstances:

Employees who work less than 40 hours during their first and/or last week of employment will be paid a proportionate part of their full salary for the time actually worked.

Employees may be suspended without pay for other types of workplace misconduct, but only in full day increments. This refers to suspensions imposed according to a written policy applicable to all employees regarding serious misconduct, including, but not limited to, workplace harassment, violence, drug and alcohol violations, legal violations, etc. The possibility of unpaid suspensions is included into all similar policies.

This policy is subject to applicable state law regarding reduction of exempt employees’ salaries if the state law is more favorable to employees. 

<a name="prohibited-reductions"></a>
### Prohibited Reductions/Complaint Procedure 

Any salaried exempt employee whose salary is reduced, and the reduction itself is in violation of this policy, will be reimbursed. If you feel your salary has been improperly reduced, please notify your Insperity human resource specialist. No employee will be penalized in any way for making a complaint.  
This policy is intended solely to implement Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) regulatory requirements, and applicable state law will be applied and modified as necessary in accordance with the requirements, and is not to be considered any type of contract.

<a name="hours-of-operation"></a>
## HOURS OF OPERATION

Normal operating hours for The OWASP Foundation are from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM, Monday through Friday in the employees location. These hours may vary depending upon your position and work requirements. All exempt and non-exempt, full-time regular employees are expected to work a standard forty (40) hour work week.

Give your supervisor as much advance notice as possible for any schedule changes.

<a name="lactation-break"></a>
## LACTATION BREAK

The OWASP Foundation will provide a reasonable amount of break time, or amount of time required by state law, to accommodate a female employee’s need to express breast milk for the employee's infant child for up to one year following the child’s birth, or as required by law. The break time should, if possible, be taken concurrently with other break periods already provided. Employees should clock out for time taken for 30 minutes or more that does not run concurrently with normally scheduled break periods. The OWASP Foundation will also make a reasonable effort to provide the employee with the use of a room or other location in close proximity to the employee's work area, other than a restroom, where the employee may express milk in private. Speak with your supervisor should arrangements for a refrigerator be required. 
You should notify your immediate supervisor if you are requesting time to express breast milk under this policy.

<a name="overtime-for-nonexempt-employees"></a>
## OVERTIME FOR NONEXEMPT EMPLOYEES

Depending on the company work needs, employees will be required to work overtime when requested to do so. Nonexempt employees will be paid overtime premiums at the applicable federal or state wage rate, whichever is higher. You are responsible for clearly noting all hours worked, including any overtime hours, on your timesheet.

It is our policy that no overtime can be worked without the advance approval of your supervisor. Failure to obtain approval in advance of working the overtime is a violation of company policy and you may be subject to disciplinary action.

If, during a workweek, you are away from the job because of an injury, paid holiday, jury or witness duty, sick day or vacation day, those hours not worked will not be counted as hours worked for the purpose of computing overtime pay, even if you receive pay such as sick or vacation pay for such time missed.

<a name="prohibited-work"></a>
### Prohibited “Off the Clock” Work

Employees are not to work “off the clock” and are required to ensure that all time worked is properly recorded. If you are given directions to perform work “off the clock,” you should promptly notify your supervisor. If your supervisor has given you directions to work “off the clock” and/or has told you not to properly record all hours worked, notify your Insperity human resource specialist. You will not be penalized in any way for making such a complaint.

<a name="absenteeism-and-tardiness"></a>
## ABSENTEEISM AND TARDINESS

Regular attendance is important to the smooth operation of The OWASP Foundation. If you are late or absent, it places a burden on other employees and may impact productivity, customer satisfaction and team morale.

You are expected to be reliable and punctual by working a regular and set weekly schedule that is suitable for your job function. If you know that you will be absent or not available during regular timely working hours, notify your supervisor directly as soon as possible.  In most circumstances, you should notify your supervisor within the first 30 minutes of your work shift each day of your absence, unless you have been granted a leave of absence. In the event of a sickness or accident while performing your duties, notify your supervisor immediately.  

If you are absent for three or more consecutive workdays due to personal illness, you may be required to provide a statement from your healthcare provider, unless state or local law provides otherwise, before you will be permitted to return to work. Failure to properly report your absences may be considered a voluntary resignation of your position.

<a name="anti-harassment"></a>
## ANTI-HARASSMENT 

The OWASP Foundation and Insperity are committed to a work environment in which all individuals are treated with respect and dignity and are free from all forms of harassment and discrimination. Any form of harassment, even when not unlawful or directed at a protected category, is prohibited and will not be tolerated. All employees, including supervisors, co-workers, vendors, contractors, customers or other third parties, are expected to adhere to this policy. 

Reported or suspected occurrences of harassment or discrimination will be promptly and thoroughly investigated. Following an investigation, The OWASP Foundation and Insperity will promptly take any necessary and appropriate disciplinary action.

The OWASP Foundation and Insperity will not permit or condone any acts of retaliation against anyone who files or cooperates in the investigation of harassment or discrimination complaints.
The term “harassment” includes harassment based on any category protected by federal, state or local law, which may include, but is not limited to, unwelcome slurs, jokes, or verbal, graphic or physical conduct relating to an individual's race, color, religious creed, sex, national origin, ancestry, citizenship status, pregnancy, childbirth, physical disability, mental and/or intellectual disability, age, military status or status as a Vietnam-era or special disabled veteran, marital status, registered domestic partner or civil union status, familial status, gender (including sex stereotyping and gender identity or expression), medical condition (including, but not limited to, cancer related or HIV/AIDS related), genetic information, or sexual orientation.

Sexual harassment consists of unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature where: 

* Submission to such conduct is an explicit or implicit term or condition of employment;
* Employment decisions are based on an employee's submission to or rejection of such conduct; or
* Such conduct unreasonably interferes with an individual's work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment.

<a name="complaint-procedure"></a>
### Complaint Procedure

The OWASP Foundation and Insperity provide you with a convenient and reliable method for reporting incidents of alleged harassment, including sexual harassment, and discrimination. Any employee who feels harassed or discriminated against is encouraged to immediately inform the alleged offender that the behavior is unwelcome. In many instances, the person is unaware his or her conduct is offensive and this action alone may often resolve the problem. If the informal discussion with the alleged offender is unsuccessful in remedying the problem, or if you do not feel comfortable with such an approach, you should immediately report the conduct to your immediate supervisor, manager or company owner and the Insperity Anti-Harassment Hotline number at 844-677-3030. We cannot resolve a harassment or discrimination problem, unless we know about it. Therefore, it is your responsibility to bring those kinds of problems to our attention so we can take the necessary steps to correct any problems. The report should include all facts available to you regarding the alleged harassment, sexual harassment, or discrimination.

When you call the Insperity Anti-Harassment Hotline, please be sure to leave your name, Insperity employee identification number or the last four digits of your social security number, and the name of the client company for which you work. If you wish to make an anonymous complaint, you may do so.  However, the scope of our investigation may be limited based on the information you provide.

<a name="complaint-confidentiality"></a>
### Confidentiality

All reports of alleged harassment, sexual harassment, or discrimination will be treated seriously. Confidentiality will be maintained to the extent possible. However, to conduct a thorough investigation, certain information may need to be disclosed to other individuals, including the alleged offender.   Consequently, absolute confidentiality cannot be promised and cannot be guaranteed.  

<a name="complaint-investigation"></a>
### Investigative Procedure

Once a complaint of alleged harassment, sexual harassment, or discrimination is received, we will begin a prompt and thorough investigation. The investigation may include interviews with all involved employees, including the alleged harasser, and any employees who are aware of facts or incidents alleged to have occurred.

Following an investigation, The OWASP Foundation and Insperity will promptly take any necessary and appropriate disciplinary action. Disciplinary action will be taken if the investigation reveals that an employee has acted in a manner that is not in alignment with the goals of this policy. The OWASP Foundation and Insperity may address any workplace issue discovered during an investigation. This may include some or all of the following steps:

* Restore any lost terms, conditions, or benefits of employment to the complaining employee.
* Discipline the alleged harasser. This discipline may include written disciplinary warnings, transfer, demotion, suspension and/or termination of employment.
* If the alleged harassment, sexual harassment, or discrimination is from a vendor, contractor, customer or other third party, The OWASP Foundation and Insperity will take appropriate action to stop the conduct.
* If you have made a complaint but feel that the action taken in response has not remedied the situation, you should make an additional complaint following the complaint procedure outlined in this policy.

<a name="complaint-duties"></a>
#### Duties of Employees and Supervisors

All employees of the company, both management and non-management, are responsible for assuring that a workplace free of harassment, sexual harassment, and discrimination is maintained. Any employee may file a complaint regarding incidents experienced personally or incidents observed in the workplace. The company strives to maintain a pleasant work environment where all employees are able to effectively perform their work without interference of any type and requests the assistance of all employees in this effort.

All managers and supervisors are responsible for doing all they can to prevent and discourage harassment, sexual harassment, and discrimination from occurring. If a complaint of harassment, sexual harassment or discrimination is raised, the individual to whom the complaint is made (i.e., supervisor, manager, company owner) should act promptly to notify the Insperity Anti-Harassment hotline number so an investigation may promptly proceed. The company and Insperity may discipline any managers or supervisors who fail to follow this policy, which discipline, may include termination.

<a name="violence-in-the-workspace"></a>
## VIOLENCE IN THE WORKPLACE

The OWASP Foundation and Insperity are committed to providing a safe workplace for employees, customers, vendors, volunteers, independent contractors and others with whom we do business. The company has zero tolerance for violent acts or threats of violence.
You are expected to conduct yourself in a non-threatening, non-abusive manner at all times. Any direct, conditional or veiled threat of harm to any employee, guest or company property will be considered unacceptable behavior. Acts of violence, intimidation or bullying of others will not be tolerated.  

All employees share the responsibility in identifying and alleviating threatening or violent behaviors. Anyone who is subjected to or threatened with violence, or who is aware of another individual who has been subjected to or threatened with violence, is to immediately report this information to his/her supervisor, a management member or Insperity. You must assume that any threat is serious. The company will carefully investigate reports and maintain employee confidentiality to the fullest extent possible.

The OWASP Foundation will take disciplinary action, up to and including termination, and/or legal action as appropriate, against any employee who commits or threatens to commit a violent act against any person while on company premises or while engaged in company business off the premises.

<a name="drue-free-workspace"></a>
## DRUG-FREE WORKPLACE

The OWASP Foundation is committed to protecting the safety, health and well-being of all employees, customers, clients, and vendors in our workplace. “Workplace” includes company property, any company-sponsored activity or any other site where you are performing work or representing the company.  

The term “drug” as used in this policy includes alcoholic beverages and prescription drugs, as well as illegal inhalants and illegal drugs and/or controlled substances including, but not limited to, marijuana, opiates (e.g., heroin, morphine), cocaine, phencyclidine (PCP), and amphetamines. 

All employees are expected to contribute to maintaining a drug-free workplace. Prohibited activities under this policy include the possession, use, sale, attempted sale, distribution, manufacture, purchase, attempted purchase, transfer or cultivation of drugs in the workplace. Employees are also prohibited from being at the workplace with a detectable amount of drugs in their system. However, the use and/or possession of prescription drugs, when taken as directed and obtained with a valid prescription under federal law, is not a violation of this policy.

As a condition of continued employment, all employees must comply with this policy.  An employee who engages in an activity prohibited by this policy shall be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including immediate termination of employment.

Contact the Employee Assistance Program (EAP) for information about the availability of treatment programs such as assistance provided by Insperity’s health care plan coverage or drug and alcohol abuse rehabilitation and education programs. 

This policy is not intended to replace or otherwise alter applicable U.S. Department of Transportation obligations or any other federal, state or local agency drug testing regulations related to a particular industry.

<a name="weapons"></a>
## WEAPONS

The OWASP Foundation strives to provide a safe and secure workplace for employees, clients, customers and visitors. The company has zero tolerance for, and forbids the possession of any type of weapon, firearm, explosive and/or ammunition while on company property or conducting company business. For purposes of this policy, company property includes, but is not limited to, all company facilities, company-provided vehicles and equipment that are either leased or owned by the company or a company client.  

Possession of firearms or other weapons may be cause for discipline, including, but not limited to, immediate termination of employment. In enforcing this policy, The OWASP Foundation reserves the right to request inspections of any employee and their personal effects while on company property, to the extent allowable under applicable law. Any employee who refuses to allow an inspection will be subject to the same disciplinary action as having been found in possession of firearms or other weapons.

## Unlimited Vacation

Exempt employees do not accrue Personal-time-off benefits but are given an indeterminate amount of personal time off at the sole discretion of the company as operational conditions permit. During such personal time taken off, employees will receive no additional fixed pay. Rather, they will continue to receive their regular salary during their scheduled Personal-time-off.

If more than five continuous days are taken as time off due to illness, the employee will cease to receive his/her regular salary and the company will consider a request for a leave of absence. Additionally, absences for three or more consecutive workdays due to personal illness may require a statement from your healthcare provider before you will be permitted to return to work.

## PERSONAL LEAVE OF ABSENCE

You may be granted a leave of absence to attend to personal matters in situations in which the company determines that an extended period of time away from the job will be in your and the company’s  best interest.

Requests for a leave of absence or any extension of a leave should be submitted in writing to your supervisor at least 30 days prior to commencement of the leave period or as soon as is practicable. Your supervisor will forward the request to the appropriate manager recommending approval or denial. Management will make the final decision concerning the request.

You may be required to use all accrued paid time off while on leave before going on unpaid leave. For information on health care coverage during a leave of absence, refer to the Continuation of Benefits policy. Benefits that accrue according to length of service, such as paid time off, holiday, and sick days, do not accrue during periods of leave.

Upon return from a personal leave due to an illness or injury, you must provide a release to return to work. Any restrictions must be noted on the release. The company will consider modifications or adjustments to help facilitate your return to work. 

A personal leave of absence may not provide a guarantee of reinstatement to the same or similar position.

The company will not reimburse employees for office-related expenses, such as but not limited to heating and cooling costs, internet service, and other home-related services.

Injuries sustained by an employee while at a home work location and in conjunction with regular work duties are normally covered by the company's workers' compensation policy. Employees who work remotely are responsible for notifying The OWASP Foundation of such injuries in accordance with the company’s workers' compensation procedures. However, the company assumes no responsibility for injuries occurring in the employee’s at-home work space outside the agreed-upon work hours. Employees who work remotely are to maintain safe work conditions in their at-home work space and are to practice the same safety habits as those followed on typical corporate premises. The employee’s home location is mainly for the employee and should not be used for meeting with customers, vendors or other company-related guests.

Consistent with the company's expectations of information security, even while working remotely employees are expected to ensure the protection of proprietary company and customer information accessible from their home office. Steps include, but are not limited to, the use of locked file cabinets, computers and desks; the regular maintenance of passwords; and any other steps appropriate for the job and the environment.

Sick time may be used for your own or your family member’s health needs, purposes relating to being a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking, for purposes related to when your worksite or your child’s school or care facility is closed by order of public official due to a public health emergency, or to attend a school-related conference or event requested by or required by a school administrator, teacher or other professional staff member, as intended to comply with New Jersey Paid Sick Leave Act.

Indications of possible abuse include, but are not limited to, repeated usage of sick time to extend regularly scheduled days off, including weekends, holidays (before or after a holiday), excessive absenteeism on Mondays and Fridays, and usage of sick time on days previously requested and denied as vacation. If you are absent for three or more consecutive workdays due to personal illness, or other reasons as covered under the Act, you may be required to provide reasonable documentation, such as a statement from your health care provider. Please familiarize yourself with the Absenteeism and Tardiness Policy for the proper procedures to follow when an absence has or will occur.

Employees classified as exempt may take sick time in 4-hour increments. Nonexempt employees should record their absences in exact time increments to the quarter hour.
